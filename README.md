HomeAutomationProject
=====================
This is the code for our Open Source Arduino project.

The Receiver code is based on the RC-Switch library, 
which is available at https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/

It is designed to work with the Raspberry Pi port of RC-Switch,
though theoretically any RF transmitter could send the proper
codes and it would work.
